# CamJam Control

This repository contains a ROS2 package for controlling the CamJam Edukit #3 robot using a Raspberry Pi. It was tested using ROS2 Jazzy on a Raspberry Pi 2W running Ubuntu 24.04, but other software versions or Raspberry Pi editions may also work.

It is intended to run as a ROS 2 package and depends on the [`camjam_sensors`](https://hithub.com/mikelikesrobots/camjam_sensors) package for sensor data within the launch file.

For instructions on how to use this package, see [my blog post](https://mikelikesrobots.github.io/blog/raspi-camjam-ros2).
